**How to run the program:**
Just click the Lomente_Bankers.exe file. IF THE EXECUTABLE FILE WON'T WORK PLEASE USE THE JAR FILE AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION BELOW:
            To run the file, MUST use the TERMINAL and run the .jar file:  
            Run this command inside the Bankers_Algorithm/dist directory  
                        "java -jar Bankers_Algorithm.jar" 

This do not have a **.exe file** because the **.jar file** that was compiled and build in my **Linux machine** won't run properly in **Windows**. The **.jar file** will only run in windows using its command prompt.
